# Countries-Aliases
Collection of different aliases of which country in The World in json format. 
Every country at limit has such data as name, common name, official name, alpha2 and alpha3 codes.


# Notes
Sometimes, common and official names are not present in the list.
the-world.txt was compiled that way so Wikipedia API recognizes it as countries, which was a primary concern for me.
